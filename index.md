I am [Jerome Briot]({{ "/" | relative_url }}) and I can help you to materialize your scientific or industrial project. You have strong expertise and you know what you want. Do you lack mechanical, computer or electronic resources? Do you need to validate a feasibility or design a prototype? Thanks to my multi-skill profile, my network and your expertise, we will lead your project together to success.

I design and I prototype devices and softwares since {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 2000 }} years for professionals from different fields: researchers, industrialists, surgeons, veterinarians, biologists… I had the chance to work with people from all over the world: Japan, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia, United States, Canada, China, Colombia, Chile… and some French words too!

[Contact me]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}) now or check my [resume]({{ "/resume/" | relative_url }}) first if you want to know more about my background.
