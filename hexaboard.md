My role: 3D design, 3D printing.

Hexaboard is an electronic card designed to access sensors directly in Python or MATLAB. The board embeds a Microchip MCP2221 which is a USB-to-UART/I2C serial converter. The board was originaly designed by Arnauld Biganzoli for teaching purpose.

The board design was imported from Eagle in Fusion 360 using the "IDF import" addin (available for Mac and Window). The CAD models of the electric components was added from GrabCAD.
