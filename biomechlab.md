biomechLAB is a tool for research studies that I wrote in the Biomechanics Laboratory in Toulouse, France. Its a software dedicated to the study of articular and bone structures that is mainly used by orthopedic surgeons.

The tool allows:
* to read DICOM images
* to segment images
* reconstruct 3D structures
* to quantify volumes, strains ans other spatial parameters
* to generate files for 3D printers
* to interface with FEA softwares

biomechLAB is coded in MATLAB and requires no toolbox.

biomechLAB is used at the Children Hospital in Toulouse (France) for a long term study on scoliotic childs.
