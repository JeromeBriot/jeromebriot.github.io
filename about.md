I'm a freelance R&D engineer with more than 15 years of experience.

Main skills:
* Computer programming (MATLAB, Python, C)
* 3D CAD modeling (Fusion 360)
* 3D printing (Ultimaker printers)

My background is in mechanical engineering and I have a PhD in biomechanics. I worked for 15 years as a research engineer at the Purpan Hospital in Toulouse, France.
