My role: 3D design, 3D printing, microcontroler and software programming.

Openfeeder is a research project carry on by the [Station for Theorical and Experimental Ecology](http://www.ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} situated in the foothills of the Pyrenees in the department Ariege (France).

The Openfeeder is a device used to study global warming effects and mountain climate effects on the behavior and intelligence of birds.

For this project, I developped the C code embedded in the electronical board and I designed pieces that were made with 3D printers.
