## Openfeeder

Openfeeder is a research project carry on by the [Station for Theorical and Experimental Ecology](http://www.ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} situated in the foothills of the Pyrenees in the department Ariege (France).

The Openfeeder is a device used to study global warming effects and mountain climate effects on the behavior and intelligence of birds.

For this project, I developped the C code embedded in the electronical board and I designed pieces that were made with 3D printers.

More information on the [website](https://openfeeder.github.io/){:target="_blank"} (fr) of the project.

## Add-ins for Autodesk&reg; Fusion 360&trade;

[Autodesk&reg; Fusion 360&trade;](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) is a cloud-based 3D CAD/CAM/CAE software for product design. Its functionnalities can be extended via codes written in C++ or Python.

I developped the following extensions:
* [IDF file import](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/fr/Detail/Index?id=3201819144576582682&appLang=en&os=Win64){:target="_blank"}

## Add-ins for MATLAB&reg;

MATLAB&reg; is a programming language ans an integrated development environment (IDE). I'm a daily user since 2000. I developped several extensions available at the [File Exchange](https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/492531-jerome-briot?utf8=%E2%9C%93&detail2=&detail=fileexchange){:target="_blank"}.

## biomechLAB

biomechLAB is a tool for research studies that I wrote in the Biomechanics Laboratory in Toulouse, France. Its a software dedicated to the study of articular and bone structures that is mainly used by orthopedic surgeons.

![biomechLAB]({{ "/assets/images/biomechlab.png" | relative_url }})

The tool allows:
* to read DICOM images
* to segment images
* reconstruct 3D structures
* to quantify volumes, strains ans other spatial parameters
* to generate files for 3D printers
* to interface with FEA softwares

biomechLAB is coded in MATLAB and requires no toolbox.

biomechLAB is used at the Children Hospital in Toulouse (France) for a long term study on scoliotic childs.
