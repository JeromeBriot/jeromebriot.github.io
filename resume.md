I worked for 15 years in medical research. I carried out **innovative projects** with professionals from **different fields**: researchers, industrialists, surgeons, veterinarians, biologists… I also had the chance to **meet** and **exchange** with people from all over the world: Japan, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia, United States, Canada, Syria, China, Colombia , Chile… and some French people too!

Freelance since 2015, I carry on activities with some French research centers. I work on personnal projects also.

Since 2006, I **have volunteered** on the Developpez.com **support** website that I joined to create the French community of **MATLAB** users. I was previously an active member of the MATLAB English forum on the MathWorks site. I'm also now supporting the **Fusion 360 API and Scripts** forum on the Autodesk website.
